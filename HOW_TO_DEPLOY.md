## 🚀 COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Download Frontend Files (1 minute)

**Option A: Download the FRONTEND_PACKAGE folder**
1. Locate the `FRONTEND_PACKAGE` folder in your outputs
2. Copy the entire folder to your computer
3. Rename it to: `cat8004-minter`

**Option B: Download individual files**
1. Download all files from the FRONTEND_PACKAGE folder
2. Create folder structure as shown above
3. Place files in correct locations

---

### STEP 2: Install Node.js (5 minutes - Skip if already installed)

**Check if you have Node.js:**
```bash
node --version
```

If you see `v18.x.x` or higher, you're good! Skip to Step 3.

**If not installed:**
1. Go to: https://nodejs.org
2. Download **LTS version** (green button)
3. Run installer
4. Follow installation steps
5. Restart terminal/command prompt
6. Verify: `node --version`

---

### STEP 3: Get Your Contract Address (From Remix)

**You should have this from deploying the contract:**
- Example: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`

**If you haven't deployed the contract yet:**
1. Follow: REMIX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. Deploy contract first
3. Come back here with your contract address

---

### STEP 4: Get WalletConnect Project ID (3 minutes)

1. Go to: https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (or log in)
3. Click **"Create New Project"**
4. Name it: "Cat8004 Minter"
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **Copy your Project ID** (looks like: `abc123def456...`)
7. Keep it handy!

---

### STEP 5: Edit Configuration Files ⚠️ CRITICAL!

**You MUST edit these 2 files:**

#### File 1: lib/contract.ts

1. Open `cat8004-minter/lib/contract.ts` in any text editor
2. Find line 1:
```typescript
export const CAT8004_ADDRESS = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
```
3. Replace with YOUR actual contract address:
```typescript
export const CAT8004_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678";
```
4. **Save the file**

#### File 2: lib/wagmi.ts

1. Open `cat8004-minter/lib/wagmi.ts` in any text editor
2. Find line 7:
```typescript
projectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
```
3. Replace with YOUR WalletConnect Project ID:
```typescript
projectId: 'abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345',
```
4. **Save the file**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Make sure to:
- Keep the quotes `" "` around the address
- Keep the single quotes `' '` around the project ID
- No extra spaces
- Save both files!

---

### STEP 6: Install Dependencies (3 minutes)

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd path/to/cat8004-minter
```

Example:
```bash
# Windows
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\cat8004-minter

# Mac/Linux
cd ~/Documents/cat8004-minter
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Wait 2-3 minutes. You'll see:
```

**⚠️ If you see errors:**
Try this instead:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

---

### STEP 7: Test Locally (2 minutes)

1. In the same terminal, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Wait 5-10 seconds. You'll see:

> next dev

✓ Ready in 3.5s
○ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

3. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

**What you should see:**
